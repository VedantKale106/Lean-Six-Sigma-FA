# Call Center Performance Improvement using Lean Six Sigma

This project applies the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology to enhance the performance of a customer service call center. The primary focus is on reducing the Average Call Handling Time (AHT) to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## üìù Project Overview

[cite_start]The call center experienced a significant 20% increase in Average Call Handling Time (AHT) over the last quarter[cite: 4]. [cite_start]This led to several negative consequences, including longer customer wait times, higher call abandonment rates, and a noticeable decline in customer satisfaction[cite: 6, 7, 8]. [cite_start]A preliminary analysis pointed towards issues with a complex call assessment process and insufficient staff training[cite: 10, 11].

[cite_start]The main objective of this project was to **reduce the AHT by at least 15% within a 3-month period** without negatively impacting the quality of customer service[cite: 13].

##  metodolog√≠a DMAIC Framework

The project was structured around the five phases of the DMAIC framework.

###  D - Define Phase
In this initial phase, the project's foundation was established.

* [cite_start]**Background**: The call center manages over 10,000 calls monthly, with AHT, call abandonment rate, and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) as key performance indicators[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Problem Statement**: A high AHT of 8.4 minutes is causing operational delays and customer dissatisfaction[cite: 17, 20].
* [cite_start]**Voice of the Customer (VOC)**: Customers expressed frustration with long hold times, having to repeat information, and agents seeming unprepared[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Project Goal**: To achieve a 15% reduction in AHT within three months for all inbound support calls[cite: 21, 22].

### M - Measure Phase
This phase focused on collecting data to establish a performance baseline.

* [cite_start]**Data Collection**: Key metrics such as AHT, agent performance, call types, queue times, and First Call Resolution (FCR) were systematically collected[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Baseline Performance**: The initial data revealed an **AHT of 8.4 minutes**, a **call abandonment rate of 12%**, and a **CSAT score of 78%**[cite: 26]. [cite_start]The target metrics were set at an AHT of ‚â§ 7 minutes, an abandonment rate of ‚â§ 8%, and a CSAT score of ‚â• 85%[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]**Tools Used**: To visualize and understand the process, tools like SIPOC diagrams, Histograms, and Run Charts were employed[cite: 27].

### A - Analyze Phase
The focus of the Analyze phase was to identify the root causes of the high AHT.

* [cite_start]**Root Cause Analysis**: Through the use of a Fishbone Diagram and Pareto analysis, several primary root causes were identified[cite: 31].
* **Key Findings**: The most significant factors contributing to the increased AHT were:
    * [cite_start]**Training Gaps** [cite: 32]
    * [cite_start]**Slowness of the CRM system** [cite: 33]
    * [cite_start]**Inefficient call routing** [cite: 34]


### I - Improve Phase
This phase involved developing and implementing solutions to address the identified root causes.

* **Solutions Implemented**:
    * [cite_start]**Process Optimization**: Call scripts were refined to eliminate redundant steps[cite: 37].
    * [cite_start]**Technology & Training**: Skill-based call routing was introduced, weekly refresher training sessions were initiated, the knowledge base indexing was upgraded, and CRM performance enhancements were implemented[cite: 38, 39, 40, 41].
* [cite_start]**Pilot Program**: A two-week pilot test of these solutions yielded significant improvements across all key metrics[cite: 42].

### C - Control Phase
The final phase focused on sustaining the improvements over the long term.

* [cite_start]**Standardization**: New Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were created to document the optimized process flow[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**Monitoring**: A real-time AHT dashboard was implemented for ongoing monitoring, and control charts are now used to track performance[cite: 45, 46].
* [cite_start]**Continuous Improvement**: The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle was adopted to ensure continuous improvement, supported by monthly refresher training sessions[cite: 45, 46].

## üìä Key Results & Achievements

The solutions implemented during the Improve phase resulted in substantial gains, validated by a two-week pilot program.

| Metric | Before | After (Pilot) | Target |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **AHT** | 8.4 min | 7.1 min | ‚â§ 7 min |
| **Abandonment Rate**| 12% | 9% | ‚â§ 8% |
| **CSAT** | 78% | 84% | ‚â• 85% |
[cite_start][cite: 43, 29]

### Expected Long-Term Benefits
* [cite_start]**15-20% reduction** in Average Call Handling Time[cite: 48].
* [cite_start]A decrease of approximately **4%** in the call abandonment rate[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]A **7-10% increase** in Customer Satisfaction scores[cite: 50].
* [cite_start]Improved overall agent efficiency and morale[cite: 51].

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Visualizations

A variety of Six Sigma and data analysis tools were utilized throughout the project:
* **SIPOC Diagram**: To map the high-level process.
* **Histograms & Run Charts**: For baseline performance visualization.
* **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram**: To brainstorm potential root causes.
* **Pareto Chart**: To prioritize the most significant root causes.
* **Control Charts**: For monitoring process stability post-improvement.
