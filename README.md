# Call Center Performance Improvement using Lean Six Sigma  

This project applies the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology to enhance the performance of a customer service call center. The primary focus is on reducing the Average Call Handling Time (AHT) to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

***

## üìù Project Overview  

The call center experienced a significant 20% increase in Average Call Handling Time (AHT) over the last quarter. This led to several negative consequences, including longer customer wait times, higher call abandonment rates, and a noticeable decline in customer satisfaction. A preliminary analysis pointed towards issues with a complex call assessment process and insufficient staff training.  

The main objective of this project was to **reduce the AHT by at least 15% within a 3-month period** without negatively impacting the quality of customer service.

## DMAIC Framework  

The project was structured around the five phases of the DMAIC framework.  

### D - Define Phase  
In this initial phase, the project's foundation was established.  

* **Background**: The call center manages over 10,000 calls monthly, with AHT, call abandonment rate, and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) as key performance indicators.  
* **Problem Statement**: A high AHT of 8.4 minutes is causing operational delays and customer dissatisfaction.  
* **Voice of the Customer (VOC)**: Customers expressed frustration with long hold times, having to repeat information, and agents seeming unprepared.  
* **Project Goal**: To achieve a 15% reduction in AHT within three months for all inbound support calls.  

***

### M - Measure Phase  
This phase focused on collecting data to establish a performance baseline.  

* **Data Collection**: Key metrics such as AHT, agent performance, call types, queue times, and First Call Resolution (FCR) were systematically collected.  
* **Baseline Performance**: The initial data revealed an AHT of 8.4 minutes, a call abandonment rate of 12%, and a CSAT score of 78%.  
  * Target metrics were set at an AHT of ‚â§ 7 minutes, abandonment rate ‚â§ 8%, and CSAT ‚â• 85%.  
* **Tools Used**: To visualize and understand the process, tools like SIPOC diagrams, Histograms, and Run Charts were employed.

### A - Analyze Phase  
The focus of the Analyze phase was to identify the root causes of the high AHT.  

* **Root Cause Analysis**: Fishbone Diagram and Pareto analysis were used.  
* **Key Findings**:  
  * Training gaps  
  * Slowness of the CRM system  
  * Inefficient call routing  

***

### I - Improve Phase  
This phase involved developing and implementing solutions to address the identified root causes.  

* **Solutions Implemented**:  
  * **Process Optimization**: Call scripts were refined to eliminate redundant steps.  
  * **Technology & Training**: Skill-based call routing was introduced, weekly refresher training sessions started, knowledge base indexing was upgraded, and CRM performance enhancements were implemented.  

* **Pilot Program**: A two-week pilot test of these solutions yielded significant improvements across all key metrics.  

***

### C - Control Phase  
The final phase focused on sustaining the improvements over the long term.  

* **Standardization**: New Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were created to document the optimized process flow.  
* **Monitoring**: A real-time AHT dashboard was implemented for ongoing monitoring, with control charts tracking process stability.  
* **Continuous Improvement**: The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle was adopted to ensure continuous improvement, supported by monthly refresher training.

## üìä Key Results & Achievements  

The solutions implemented during the Improve phase resulted in substantial gains, validated by a two-week pilot program.  

| Metric | Before | After (Pilot) | Target |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **AHT** | 8.4 min | 7.1 min | ‚â§ 7 min |
| **Abandonment Rate**| 12% | 9% | ‚â§ 8% |
| **CSAT** | 78% | 84% | ‚â• 85% |

### Expected Long-Term Benefits  
* 15-20% reduction in Average Call Handling Time  
* Decrease of approximately 4% in call abandonment rate  
* 7-10% increase in Customer Satisfaction scores  
* Improved overall agent efficiency and morale

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Visualizations  

A variety of Six Sigma and data analysis tools were utilized throughout the project:  
* **SIPOC Diagram**: To map the high-level process.  
* **Histograms & Run Charts**: For baseline performance visualization.  
* **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram**: To brainstorm potential root causes.  
* **Pareto Chart**: To prioritize the most significant root causes.  
* **Control Charts**: For monitoring process stability post-improvement.
